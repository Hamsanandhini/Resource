<p>One of the main reason of water pollution is the discharge  of  untreated industrial waste and sewage into  waterbodies like sea,ocean,etc.</p>
<p> Chemical fertilisers and pesticides used for agriculture washes away when it rains and mix in the near by waterbody by which the water get contaminated.</p> 
<p>Dumping garbages,plastics and other waste materials which contains nitrates and metals into the waterbodies is also a reason of water pollution.</p>
<p>One of the worst types of water pollution is oil leakage from ships which is the reason for the marine animals to die.12% of oil that enters the ocean comes from tanker acidents.</p>
<p>Drilling under the ocean seabed for oil, has caused various incidents of water pollution when certain precautions are not taken, and all the oil is spilled in the ocean, in the process  killing  thousands of aquatic life.</p>
<p>Washing clothes and vehicles in rivers are also the reasons for water pollution.</p>
<p>Highways are covered with chemicals and toxics like petrol on it.When it rains these chemicals wash into rivers and drains causing the pollution.</p>
